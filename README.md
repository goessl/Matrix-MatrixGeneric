# Matrix & MatrixGeneric

MatrixGeneric class used to store and operate on generic matricies and Matrix
class for mathematical usage with double values.
The indices of the elements are zero indexed.

This package also includes JMatrixPanel, which is an extension of JPanel and
can display a matrix graphically.

## Usage

The dimensions of both classes are imutable and must be known when calling
any of the constructors.
All basic getters & setters are implemented.
Many methods (and constructors) use the Java functional interfaces for simple
ways to initialize, set or modify the elements of the matrix and operate
on the matrix itself or multiple matricies at once.

The matrix class also implements basic mathematical operations:
 - Addition
 - Subtraction
 - Scalar multiplication
 - Matrix multiplication
 - Elementwise multiplication (Hadamard product)
 - Elementwise division
 - Transposition
Other operations can be implemented easily with the foreach & apply methods.
The foreach methods modify the elements of the matrix itself and
the apply methods return their result as a new matrix.

## Getting Started

Simply download this repository and add it to your project as a new package!
Done!
